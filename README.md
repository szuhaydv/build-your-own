# Build Your Own
"Build Your Own" is how I came to call the movement of implementing things by yourself,
for yourself – instead of relying on third party tooling.

The stack got so tall that it became
convenient to live in a top floor apartment, while everything below is abstracted away. *But* 
this has been the cause of many terrible software decisions and terrible tools being distributed, and 
much pain in the userspace.
